# Frontend

### What's here...
(Only important things explained)

---

#### Src

In the `src` folder, you will find the JSX components for the UI. Some files do not render a visible interface but instead perform operations or handle logic. (These might eventually be converted to regular JavaScript files that are imported into actual JSX components.) The core reason to have JSX is, of course, to build a user interface.

Additionally, `src` contains a `__test__` directory, which is currently empty. Tests will be gradually added as part of a test-driven development approach to ensure the UIâ€™s look and functionality remain correct.

#### Troubleshooting...

Currently empty, but will be updated if any frontend-specific issues arise.
